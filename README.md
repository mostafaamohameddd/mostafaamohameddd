## Highlight Projects

- **End-to-end-Real-Time-Face-Emotion-Detection**  
 Developed an end-to-end, low-latency system using PyTorch ResNet50 fine-tuned on RAF-DB for live emotion analysis. Leveraged OpenCV and Flask and ensured production-grade deployment using Docker on Hugging  Face Spaces for high availability.

- **GAIA-Net-Genetic-AI-Algorithm-for-Edge-Efficiency-Optimization**  
  Engineered an End-to-End Neural Architecture Search (NAS) solution using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to auto-generate highly efficient DL models. Achieved a crucial balance between high accuracy and extreme    efficiency ($<10\text{k}$ parameters) for resource-constrained IoT Edge devices

- **Real-Time-Speech-Command-Recognition**  
  Built a lightweight, real-time command recognition system classifying five spoken commands using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Trained on the TensorFlow Speech Commands dataset to enable hands-
  free interaction for simple IoT integrations.
